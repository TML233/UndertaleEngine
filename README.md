**Undertale Engine** is a GameMaker project template with pre-made code and resources all ready for making Undertale fangames.
It includes the battle system, the overworld system, the multi-language system alongside other various useful features.

It is originally based on old GameMaker Studio 2 versions (prior than 2.3).
We are currently upgrading the project to comply with the latest GameMaker feature changes. If you're looking for the old version of this project, you can find it in the `old_version` and `old_version_examples` branches.
